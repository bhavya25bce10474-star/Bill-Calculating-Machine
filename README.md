Project Overview: 
This project is about understanding the problems of retail shop businessmen for their billing and discount offers and policy with variety of items that they sell in their respective shops.
This will help them doing the billing effectively and faster and also to keep the record of their products selling and the stocks left.

Project Summary: 
When we run the project the first interface will be either we have to generate the bill or we have to check the record of our products.
Generate Bill: It will show the interface about the item code and quantity which will later go on to the membership status and generate the final bill accordingly with all the discounts and offers applicable. 
Admin Login: It will give the interface about our record after inserting the admin username and password. Which you can modify and add changes according to you.

 Discount Logic:
Subtotal discount:

20% off for total ≥ ₹500

10% off for total ≥ ₹200

5% off for total ≥ ₹100

No discount otherwise

Membership Discount:

Additional 10% off if the membership code is valid (name + 10-digit phone).

 Customization:
You can
Edit or add items in the items dictionary at the start.

Change admin username/password.

Modify discount rules in get_discount().

Adjust membership validation in check_membership_code().
 
Conclusion:
At Last i want to say that it is a user-friendly Python billing app for shops, with inventory management, admin controls, and automated discounts for regular and member customers.
